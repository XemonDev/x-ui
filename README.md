# Single Command Install & upgrade

````
bash <(curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XemonDev/x-ui/master/install.sh)
````

## Manual install & upgrade

1. First update your system
1. Then download the latest compressed package from https://github.com/XemonDev/x-ui/releases/latest, generally choose `amd64` architecture
2. Upload the compressed package to the `/root/` directory of the server, and use the `root` user to log in to the server and run following commands

> If your server cpu architecture is not `amd64`, replace `amd64` in the command with another architecture

````
rm x-ui/ /usr/local/x-ui/ /usr/bin/x-ui -rf
tar zxvf x-ui-linux-amd64.tar.gz
chmod +x x-ui/x-ui x-ui/bin/xray-linux-* x-ui/x-ui.sh
cp x-ui/x-ui.sh /usr/bin/x-ui
cp -f x-ui/x-ui.service /etc/systemd/system/
mv x-ui/ /usr/local/
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable x-ui
systemctl restart x-ui
````

## Install using docker

> This docker tutorial and docker image are provided by [Chasing66](https://github.com/Chasing66)

1. Install docker

```shell
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
````

2. Install x-ui

```shell
mkdir x-ui && cd x-ui
docker run -itd --network=host \
    -v $PWD/db/:/etc/x-ui/ \
    -v $PWD/cert/:/root/cert/ \
    --name x-ui --restart=unless-stopped \
    enwaiax/x-ui:latest
````

> Build your own image

```shell
docker build -t x-ui .
````

## SSL certificate application

The script has 2 built-in SSL certificate application functions. Using a sub-domain is recommended.
- ### 1st Method (Recommended. Works for almost any TLD including Freenom free TLDs)
To use this method to apply for a certificate, your server's IP addres being correctly pointed to a domain or subdomain that you own is the only requirement. (Acme.sh script's 3rd option)

- ### 2nd Method (Use if the above one fails. Would not work for Freenom free TLDs)
This is not beginner frienly as much as the first one. To use this method, all of the follwoing prerequisites should be met:
- Knowing the Cloudflare registered email address
- Knowing the Cloudflare Global API Key
- Having domain name has been resolved to the current server through cloudflare

How to get the Cloudflare Global API Key:
1. Visit the link https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
2. Click on View Global API Key (See the screenshot below)
        ![](media/APIKey1.PNG)
3. You may have to re-authenticate your account. After that, the API Key will be shown (See the screenshot below)\
        ![](media/APIKey2.png)

When using, just enter `domain name`, `email`, `API KEY`, the diagram is as follows:
        ![](media/DetailEnter.png)

Precautions:

- The script uses DNS API for certificate request
- Use Let'sEncrypt as the CA party by default. You can choose between Zerossl.com or Buypass.com
- The certificate installation directory is the /root/ directory
- The certificates applied for by this script are all generic domain name certificates


## Suggested OSs

- CentOS 7+
- Ubuntu 16+
- Debian 8+

## Telegram Bot Setup Guie
X-UI English supports daily traffic notification, panel and sercer login reminder and other functions through Telegram bot.

**Bot Fuctions**
- Inbounds traffic usage
- Panel login reminder
- Server SSH reminder
- Inbounds expiration alert
- Traffic warning reminder
- Daily summery at a pre-defined time
And more to come.....

Follow these steps correclty to activate X-UI English Telegram Bot:
1. Head to [Botfather bot](https://t.me/BotFather). Start it and send /newbot command. Follow the Bot's instruvtions for setting a name and username for your bot. Upon a successful new bot creation, you'll see a message like follows. which contains your API key. Keep it somewhere safer. You'll need it later.

2. Then, start [GetUIDs Bot](https://t.me/getidsbot) and send it a message. Copy the number under "You". See the following screenshot.

## Note for Beginner Devs
Hey Beginner Developer! Appreciate your intrest on playing the codes with this repository. I have seen many people who are not much familiar with none of the languages used here, but still need to do some modifications such as translating the UIs to their native language, modifying telegram bot functions and etc... But after they are done with all of these code modifications, some of them having hard times converting their code into a binary. So they contact me and I have to repeatedly tell them the same procedure. So, here's how you can do it by yourself.
- Head to `Your fork repository link`/actions . Enable Github Actions if it isn't yet.
- Click on Relese X-ui under All workflows
- Finally, click Run workflow twice. Wait untill the workflow run finishes. Once finished, you will find a release packages with your modifications at `Your fork repository link`/releases
 
If you are looking to modify Telegram Bot functions, the Bot's code lives at `/web/service/telegram.go`

**Happy Coding, Beginner Dev!**
